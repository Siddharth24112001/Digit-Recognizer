# Digit-Recognizer


## Overview

This project involves the classification of digit images using machine learning techniques. The objective is to accurately identify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset.

## Project Highlights

- Dataset: MNIST dataset, a collection of 28x28 pixel grayscale images of handwritten digits (0 through 9).
- Data Augmentation: Extended the dataset by applying image shifts in various directions.
- Model Training: Utilized the K-nearest neighbors (KNN) classifier with hyperparameter tuning using grid search.
- Accuracy: Achieved an accuracy score of 97.63% on the test dataset.
